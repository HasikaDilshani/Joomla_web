Third party developers should update their systemplugins loading the VirtueMartConfig class analogue to the virtuemart system plug-in.

<p>Also VirtueMart 3.4.2 gives users the oppportunity to test PayPal Smart Buttons. PayPal Smart Buttons offer several style options to customize the look and feel of your smart payment button. You can also use options to display multiple funding sources to the buyer, when appropriate. It is very easy to configure and deprecates the simple "PayPal Exress" and "PayPal Credit" options.</p>

<p>Due to the wide ranging changes we have made to underlying core functions and the removal of old VirtueMart and Joomla compatibility (which was weighing things down and slowing future developments), we have taken more time putting this release together than usual. Initial feedback from our beta testers has shown us that it has been worth the extra effort and time that it took.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some highlights:-</strong></p>
<p><b>Improved core</b> - VirtueMart core now benefits from using the Joomla classloader providing a more performant and more failproof method for classloading (classes are registered automatically and loaded if need.)</p>
<p><b>Ready for Joomla 3.9</b> - The core is ready for Joomla 3.9 and we expect that it will be relatively simple and fast to adapt for Joomla 4</p>
<p><b>PHP 7.2 - compatible</b> - VirtueMart 3.4 is now php7.2 compatible, users can now benefit from more secure and faster PHP versions.</p>
<p><b>Javascript updates</b> - We started to rewrite the javascripts to use data-vm instead of classes or ids - fallbacks are provided.</p>
<p><b>VirtueMart Package improvements</b> - This now automatically installs the VirtueMart Core, AIO, vmBeez3 template and the TCPDF. The installers within the package can still be used individually for those not requiring the full installation.</p>
<p><b>Next release in progress</b> - Expect to see two new payments, eWay and PayPal's “Smart Buttons”. A new template option which loads for example layouts with a bs4 prefix allows us to develop a completely new frontend template, whilst keeping backward compatibility. We are also planning for a new backend template, for which suggestions are welcome in the forum.</p>

Shop owners running a multi-vendor store or fearing that their employees may use this leak should update as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The new core has some fixes for php 7.1 - 7.2 compatibility.</p>
<h3>Compliance to the new french financial law</h3>
<p>At present we have also integrated some fraud protection requirements to comply with the new French law. This includes, for example, the new invoice processing system. When an invoice was changed, the old treatment renamed the originally created invoice and created a new invoice with the same invoice number. The new treatment creates a regular new invoice number while the old invoice remains listed and accessible. We also added an order item history table. The class vmtable can now automatically save a hash to any entry. For example the order entries store a hash of the important data per line, so it is now possible to check the integrity of an entry. This system is not completed yet.</p>
<h2>Further features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Behaviour of the table object is more consistent and reliable.</li>
<li>Behaviour of payment plugins after pressing confirm in the cart and cancelling the payment is now more consistent.</li>
<li>Removed w3c validation errors.</li>
<li>Corrected routing for orderdone layout.</li>
<li>Trigger 'plgVmAfterStoreProduct', added array key "new" to $data, so that we know if a product is new or just updated.</li>
<li>Customfield date has now two extra parameters to set the initial date and year range. The initial date uses as format DateInterval, so the P0D means use the current.</li>
<li>Language files updated.</li>
<li>Long desired fix, dropdowns of prices in product edit work now directly.</li>
<li>Enhanced handling of the orderdone layout.</li>
<li>Minor compatibility enhancements of javascript and html.</li>
<li>_triesValidateCoupon is now emptied after entering a valid coupon.</li>
<li>Coupons are not automatically removed any longer when expired.</li>
<li>Full installer now also works with multilingual setup.</li>
